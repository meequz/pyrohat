Laugh when silence come. Thanks lleo for idea (lleo.me/blog/2011/11/27.html)

Quick start:
 - put wav files with sitcom laugh into pyrohat directory
 - run pyrohat.py and see if it works fine
 - if not, you can adjust two variables at top of pyrohat.py:
	* TIMES - time on wich calculates average level, not in seconds
	* TRESH - volume level recognized as silence
